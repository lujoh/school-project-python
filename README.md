## Description:

I made this project as the final project for my Programming in Problem Solving class.

The program uses the graphics library and a text file with a list of movies that our teacher gave us.

The program gives a user a graphic interface in which they can enter the name of a movie. When the enter button is clicked it transitions to a second user interface where the description of the movie appears if it was present on the list. Then the user has the choice to search for another movie.

The addition of the option to return to the first screen and search for another movie was my idea and not part of the assignment.

This project was my first "bigger" project that I did in class.
